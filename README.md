# colav

`colav` (Conformational Landscape Visualization) provides tools for representing protein structures and mapping conformational landscapes. 

`colav` supports calculations for dihedral angles, pairwise distances, and strain. It is built on `biopandas`, `NumPy`, and `SciPy`. The methods analyze `.pdb` files, either one-by-one or all together. The three methods currently implemented are: 

## Installation 

You can install `colav` using `pip`: 

```
pip install colav
```
